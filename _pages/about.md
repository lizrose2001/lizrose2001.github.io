If there's one thing that stands out about me, it's definitely my passion for connecting with and to others. I am an individual deeply committed to building meaningful relationships and fostering impactful connections. My love for people and their stories has been the guiding force throughout my professional, educational, and personal journey. I'm somebody to be counted on—a dedicated professional who consistently strives to deliver the highest quality of work possible. Whether it's refining someone's manuscript to perfection or providing compassionate assistance in the everyday care of others, I take pride in my unwavering commitment to “being there” for people.

I find my joy in a triad of interests—writing, learning, and community engagement. While these pursuits may at first appear disparate, I have discovered that they form a harmonious coexistence in the realm of communications and non-profit organizing. These skills have not only equipped me with the ability to conduct thorough and efficient research, but also to navigate challenges adeptly, both as an individual and within a collaborative team setting. Perhaps most importantly, they have nurtured in me a profound determination to approach every experience with an open mind.

### Skills & Experience

With a diverse range of experiences spanning across different roles and organizations, I have developed a unique set of skills that make me a well-rounded and adaptable individual. Through the positions I have held with Drew University as a Writing Fellow and Civic Engagement Mentor, I've cultivated strong mentoring and workshop facilitation skills, acting as a crucial liaison between students and faculty. My proficiency in writing and editing, evident in my roles as Senior Writer & Editor with the Woodsboro-Walkersville News Journal and as Editor-in-Chief of “The Lance,” underscores my ability to craft clear and concise content while managing online platforms. I am also well-versed in event coordination and leadership, which I have honed through my tenure as a Head Server at Morningside Inn and as Treasurer for both the Drew Roosevelt Network and Planned Parenthood Generation Action. Moreover, these experiences have helped me develop financial management and design skills. My passion for community outreach is evident in both my professional work and volunteer work with organizations like The Frederick Center, American Red Cross as well as numerous social justice initiatives. These have instilled in me a strong dedication to teamwork and collaboration, which guides me as I approach new opportunities. Collectively, all of my skills make for a versatile candidate ready for a wide array of roles and responsibilities.

### Personal Interests

Outside of my professional pursuits, I am a lifelong learner who thrives on delving deeper into issues and topics that I am passionate about. I often continue academic research past course terms, finding ways to apply it to my own life and to the world around me. My curiosity knows no bounds, and one of my favorite ways to pursue it is through nature, whether I am hiking, kayaking, or simply reading a book under a tree. Furthermore, I have always held a deep appreciation for literature and the arts, which I nurture through personal creative projects.
